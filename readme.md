# esxlab-fusion

Series of documents and config boilerplate to get a vSphere lab up and running quickly

### Prerequisites

The following are necessary to get this running:


- A sufficiently powerful Mac  
 - I'm using an iMacPro1,1 10-CPU cores and 64GB of RAM, a MacBook Pro with 4 cores and 16GB of RAM will work but with much less ability to run nested VMs and larger nested data center designs.
- VMware Fusion Pro version 10.1.1
- ISO files for: (trial license keys will work)
 - ESXi
 - vCenter Server
 - vSAN

### Installing
